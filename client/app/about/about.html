    <h1>About the Project </h1>
    <p>  The FAA predicts that 7,500 unmanned drones will be operating in the U.S. by 2018. At some point there will be a need for an air traffic control system to ensure that drones are taking the correct routes. With Drone Pass we sought to create a prototype of that system. Using geographic information systems technologies, we created a system that would allow landowners to set restrictions over their airspace. We also developed an autonomous FAA-like organization that monitors drone movements and reroutes their flight paths where needed. Air Traffic Control for Drones: Airspace authorization and restriction service for landowners, and a real time drone traffic control system.</p>
